## Q12: Inter-Process Communication Using Pipes (C Program)
Demonstrates IPC using two child processes:
- Child B collects two integers from the user and sends them to Child C through a pipe.
- Child C performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the numbers and sends the results to the parent process, which then displays them.
