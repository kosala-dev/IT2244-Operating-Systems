This README provides descriptions of various shell scripts and a C program used to demonstrate fundamental scripting and process communication concepts.

## Q8: Electronic Dice Roll
Simulates the roll of a six-sided dice using a random number generator. It outputs a number between 1 and 6 to represent the dice roll.

---

## Q9: Sort Numbers in Descending Order
Reads a specified number of integers from the user, stores them in an array, and sorts them in descending order using the Unix `sort` command.

---

## Q10: Student Marksheet Generator
Prompts the user to enter a studentâ€™s name and marks for three subjects. It calculates the total marks, average score, and assigns a grade based on the average.

---

## Q11: Multiplication Table
Takes an integer input from the user and displays its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

---

## Q12: Inter-Process Communication Using Pipes (C Program)
Demonstrates IPC using two child processes:
- Child B collects two integers from the user and sends them to Child C through a pipe.
- Child C performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the numbers and sends the results to the parent process, which then displays them.
